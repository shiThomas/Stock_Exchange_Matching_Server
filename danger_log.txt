1. What if server receives an empty from client?

In that case, our server will abort. We assume that client will only transmit valid
create or transaction xml to server.

2. What if server receives an invalid Account ID for one transaction?

When our server confront this situation, it will regard the input as an invalid input,
and will respond with an error message.

3. What if server receives an invalid Transaction ID?

The repsonse is same as the previous one, that our server will respond with an error 
message.

4. What if an user post an order to buy(at this time money is subtracted from the account), 
   then the order is executed with a lower price?

The price difference should be refunded to the account.

5. What if number of users queuing up for accessing server exceeds the maximum
   number of sockets for listening?

Our server is not able to deal with this level of scalability, and it will refuse connection
requests from clients.
